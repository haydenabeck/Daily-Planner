SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Usage
 GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
